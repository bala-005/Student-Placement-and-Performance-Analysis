# Student Placement & Performance Analysis Using MySQL

## Project Overview
This project analyzes student placement trends at Besant Technologies using MySQL. It provides insights into placement success rates, recruiter hiring patterns, test score analysis, certification impact, and dropout trends. The project helps educational institutes, recruiters, and students make data-driven decisions for better career outcomes.

## Technologies Used
- MySQL â€“ Database creation, advanced queries, views, CTEs, and stored procedures

## Project Objectives
- Analyze placement rates per course
- Identify students who completed courses but remain unplaced
- Determine certification impact on placement
- Extract insights on recruiter hiring trends
- Detect dropout rates across different courses

## Database Schema

### Students Table
```sql
CREATE TABLE Students (
    Student_ID INT PRIMARY KEY,
    Name VARCHAR(100),
    Email VARCHAR(100),
    Course VARCHAR(50),
    Completion_Status VARCHAR(20),  -- ('Completed', 'Not Completed', 'Dropped Out')
    Test_Score INT,  -- (0 to 100)
    Certification VARCHAR(10),  -- ('Yes', 'No')
    Placement_Status VARCHAR(20),  -- ('Placed', 'Not Placed')
    Recruiter_Contacted VARCHAR(10),  -- ('Yes', 'No')
    Hiring_Company VARCHAR(100) NULL,  
    Salary INT NULL  
);
```

### Hiring Companies Table
```sql
CREATE TABLE Hiring_Companies (
    Company_ID INT PRIMARY KEY,
    Company_Name VARCHAR(100),
    Job_Role VARCHAR(50),
    Total_Hires INT,
    Avg_Salary INT
);
```

## Key SQL Queries & Techniques Used

### Placement Rate per Course
```sql
SELECT Course,
       (SUM(CASE WHEN Placement_Status = 'Placed' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) * 100.0 / COUNT(*)) AS Placement_Rate
FROM Students
GROUP BY Course;
```

### Identifying Unplaced Students Who Completed Their Courses
```sql
CREATE VIEW Unplaced_Completed_Students AS
SELECT Student_ID, Name, Course
FROM Students
WHERE Completion_Status = 'Completed' AND Placement_Status = 'Not Placed';

SELECT * FROM Unplaced_Completed_Students;
```

### Certification Impact on Placement
```sql
DELIMITER //

CREATE PROCEDURE Certification_Impact()
BEGIN
    SELECT Certification, COUNT(*) AS Total_Students,
           SUM(CASE WHEN Placement_Status = 'Placed' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS Placed_Students
    FROM Students
    GROUP BY Certification;
END //

DELIMITER ;

CALL Certification_Impact();
```

## Key Insights from the Analysis
- Courses with high placement rates include Data Science and Python
- Courses with low placement rates include AWS and Full-Stack Development
- Students with certifications had a higher placement success rate
- Recruiters engaged with students had a higher hiring rate
- Dropout rates were highest in AWS and Full-Stack Development courses
